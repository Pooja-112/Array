# Array
A Array is storing a collection of multiple items under a single variable name, and has members for performing common array operations.

JavaScript arrays are resizable and can contain a mix of different data types.

JavaScript arrays are not associative arrays and so, array elements cannot be accessed using arbitrary strings as indexes, but must be accessed using nonnegative integers (or their respective string form) as indexes.

The concat() method is used to merge two or more arrays. This method does not change the existing arrays, but instead returns a new array.

The copyWithin() method shallow copies part of an array to another location in the same array and returns it without modifying its length.

The every() method tests whether all elements in the array pass the test implemented by the provided function. It returns a Boolean value.

The indexOf() method returns the first index at which a given element can be found in the array, or -1 if it is not present.
